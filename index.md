Welcome to the Harvard Embodied Intelligence Lab! We're a interdisciplinary set of researchers workly broadly on the research question
of constructing intelligent agents in the physical world, with a focus on constructing general purpose machine learning algorithms towards this 
goal. At the current moment, a research focus for the lab is the construction of robust generative models of world as well as the downstream use of the such models
for tasks such as planning, perception, and reasoning. Our lab is also focused on the broader use of these generative tools in domains such a scientific discovery and engineering design.
 Our lab is in the [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) and  computer science in the [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/).
